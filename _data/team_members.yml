  bio: I’m interested in understanding how descending pathways command the brainstem and spinal cord to initiate and modify movements—especially across different brain states (like hunger, thirst, and arousal). Previously, I was a postdoc working in the Deisseroth Lab at Stanford. Before that, I started a company called CTRL-labs that used ideas related to my doctoral work to build non-invasive technologies for decoding motor intention. I went to graduate school at Columbia where I studied spinal motor circuits. Outside of lab, I enjoy running, biking, and trying to be outside.

  bio: I’m interested in using large-scale imaging and electrophysiological recordings to understand how brainstem circuits generate precise movements. Previously I studied hippocampal representations of reward, both as a post-doc with David Tank at Princeton University and an Assistant Professor at Swarthmore College. If I’m not in lab I’m probably singing, dancing, or playing music in Philadelphia’s thriving folk music scene.

  email: Vincent.Curtis@Pennmedicine.upenn.edu
  bio: I am focused on developing devices and computational techniques to uncover latent factors in behavioral and neural data. During my PhD at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I designed a novel device to simultaneously monitor multiple biometric indicators using IR light. Now as a postdoctoral researcher, I’m excited to continue my work at the intersection of engineering and neuroscience. Outside the lab, you’ll likely find me reading, lifting weights, or spending time with my pet rats.

  bio: I am interested in using experimental and computational approaches to study how movement execution changes across internal states. I started my PhD in neuroscience in 2022. Previously, I studied action selection at University of Maryland Baltimore and cognitive flexibility at NIAAA. When I’m not in lab you can find me doing hot yoga, cooking too much food, crafting, and squealing over cute animals.

  bio: I’m interested in how the brain generates behavior and in how to use imaging and computational methods to understand brainstem motor circuitry. I started my PhD in Neuroscience in 2023. Before that, I studied opioid use disorder at NIDA and Parkinson’s disease at Duke University. Outside of lab, I like cooking for friends and spending lots of time outside.

  bio: I am interested in how sensory feedback and motor commands interact in the brainstem to adaptively shape behavior. I started my PhD in 2022 and I previously studied the role of glial cells in Alzheimer's disease. Outside of lab, I like board games, reading, and exploring Philly.

  bio: I am a joint member of the Machado and Betley labs, and I’m interested in internal verses external drivers of motivation and how they differentially modulate overlapping behaviors. I started my PhD in 2023. Before coming to UPenn, I studied behaviors of addiction and motivation during my undergraduate at Wesleyan University, and then I worked as a lab tech at the Broad Institute/MIT in Boston. In my free time I enjoy swimming, running, or knitting on the couch while listening to an audiobook.

  email: tammi@pennmedicine.upenn.edu
  bio: I have 32 years of experience as a certified animal health technician. Specializing in anesthesia, clinical care, in vivo research experiments, and behavioral training.  During my 25 years at Penn, I have collaborated with and helped five successful laboratories focused on research in Gene Therapy, Neuroscience, Otolaryngology, and Neurosurgery. As a laboratory manager for the Machado Lab, I assist staff and students with the study of how circuits across the brain send commands to control movement during different behavioral states by using multi-region neural recording techniques. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, walking with my two dogs, and making art.
